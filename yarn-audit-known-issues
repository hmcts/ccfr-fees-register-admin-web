However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n\n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n if (props.isAdmin) {\n console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n } else {\n console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n\n }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n let searchKeyFound = false;\n Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n searchKeyFound = true;\n }\n });\n return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as user.\\\"\n} else {\n throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n\nIf an attacker attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n\n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"isAdmin\\\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\ndoSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n\nHowever, attackers can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the attacker to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n\n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"__proto__\\\": {\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\\\"\n} else {\n throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"}}}

In many typical Express use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000. The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and 6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has \"deps: qs@6.9.7\" in its release description, is not vulnerable).","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp"}}}

Even though there is an optional forbidUnknownValues parameter that can be used to reduce the risk of this bypass, this option is not documented and thus most developers configure input validation in the vulnerable default manner. With this vulnerability, attackers can launch SQL Injection or XSS attacks by injecting arbitrary malicious input. NOTE: a software maintainer agrees with the \"is not documented\" finding but suggests that much of the responsibility for the risk lies in a different product.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fj58-h2fr-3pp2"}}}
